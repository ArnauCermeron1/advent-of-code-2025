# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**.
Each day has its own folder with a Python script and the corresponding input files.

```
day1/
 ├── day1.py
 ├── example.txt
 ├── input.txt
utils/
 ├── utils.py
README.md
```

## How to run a solution

From the root directory:

```bash
python3 day1/day1.py
```

Shared helpers (loading input, parsing utilities, etc.) are stored in `utils/utils.py` to avoid repeating boilerplate code.

## Goals for this year

* Keep the code readable and easy to follow.
* Avoid unnecessary complexity unless the puzzle calls for it.
* Make each day self-contained so it’s easy to revisit later.

## Notes

Both the provided example input and my personal puzzle input are included for each day.
Example files may change if I test variations, real inputs remain untouched.
